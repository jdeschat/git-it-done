Git-it-done is a website that allows you to check existing Github issues by user. Characteristics of the application includes:
- Users can enter a GitHub username and see a list of all repos from that account.
- Repos with no open issues will display a checkmark.
- Repos with open issues will display an X with the number of issues or pull requests.
- Users can click on a repository name, which will route them to a new page.
- The second HTML page will display a list of all open issues for that repository.
- Users can click on a language button to see a list of featured repos that use that language.
    - Examples: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- The list of featured repos will look exactly like the list of user repos.
